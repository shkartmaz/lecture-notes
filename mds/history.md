Expansion to the West
Three partitions of Poland.
European scholars name the 4th partition. Kingdom of Poland inside Russian Empire, had constitution. Poland had their own parliament, had
leverage in PA. Some say it was Alexander I constitutional experiment. But as far as enlightened absolutism was concerned, constitution 
was a no go.

## Jewish problem
The largest Jewish community in Europe was in Poland => became a part of Russia. One other idea of EA was tolerance towards 
all ethnicities and religions, so E-II was tolerant. Jews had a special kind of self-organisation in place, doing fiscal,
judicial, martial and other stuff. E-II was afraid of national movements, so in late 1780 she started to incorporate Jews 
into the existing Russian structure.

There were several estates:
- merchants (three guilds)
- peasants
- nobles
- urban citizens
Which ones should the Jews go to? Merchants/urbans depending on the wealth.

There was some discrimination in place, namely double tax burden. 
In 1804 A-I defined a pale of Jewish settlements, outside of which they were not permitted to settle. (Polish areas, left-bank Ukraine, New Russia).
On the other hand the statute confirmed their religious freedom and economic priveleges.

## Autonomy of Finland
Part of Finland was occupied during Nothern war, was a region of Sweden. Finns were a minority there, policies were similar to those Russia
imposed on Middle Asia in XIX century. 
Karelia was incorporated into Russia. Other part stayed in Sweden. This lasted till XIX century.
Russian part was incorporated into economics, social system etc; was better developed than Swedish Finland.

Finland was the second experimental territory.

## Bessarabia
Transnistria these days/

Snatched from Ottoman Empire in 1812. Romanian-speaking nobility and the orthodox clergy. Romanian-speaking peasants were free.
Nobility co-opted, peasantsremained free, Orthodox church was recognized within the eparchy of Kishinev.

All in all, rather mild and chill behaviour.

At the end of XVIII Russians comprised 53% of population, Ukrainians - 22%, Belorussians - 7%

Highest levels of autonomy - Poland and Finland.
Low autonomy - Bessarabia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbijan.


## Colonial expansion in Asia
"Mission" in Asia, civilizing the savage nomads.
In 1822 Speransky establised a new estate - инородцы, a transitional stage to a full citizenship for hunters, gatherers and fishermen in Asia. Europeans were citizens
straight away though - racism detected!

## Summary for late 18 - early 19
Expansion to the west

# Georigians, Armenians and muslims
West Georgia and West Armenia became parts of Ottoman Empire. Azer and Eastern Armenia were Iranian. Karabakh, Gandsha, Baku etc were
Pakistani.

Georgians and Armenians were Christian; Azers muslim.
 
The construction of Georgian Military Road has disturbed the wild Caucasians! Jihad began. Alahu akbar!

Shamil (1797-1871).

Guerilla war for 25 years, tens of thousands of soldiers lost, up to 1/6 of state income.

## The Kazakh steppe
Between Southern Ural and the Caspian sea.  
Nomadic & tribal Kazakhs. In XV split off from khanate of the Uzbeks, formed three Hordes: Young Horde, Middle Horde and Large/Older Horde.  
Khans + clan aristocracy of sultans and begs.

Opponents are Mongols (Oirats). In the beginning of XVIII Kazakhs were harassed by Orats, so they asked Russia for help.  
Between 1731 and 1742 Lil' and Mid Hordes swore allegiance to the tsar. Not part of Empire yet.

Incorporation occured in the first half of XIX. Intrtnal crisis in the Hordes, rebellion against Russia.

Administrative units: Orenburg, Siberian and Semipalatinsk.

The area south to Syr-Darya were added to Turkestan.

In 1891 special statute confirmed Kazakh status. Begs were not incorporated though

## Middle Asia
Intensive arable farming + trade. Silk Road. Urban population bilingual, tribal identity and religion more important thean ethnicity and language.

- Emirate of Bukhare
- Khanate of Khiva
- Khanate of Kokand

Russia maintained trade links with Islamic centres since XVI.

The conquest began in 1864

Colonel Cherniaev and 2600 men conquered Tashkent.  
von Kaufman  
General Skobelev  
In early 1860s Civil war in USA led to lack of cotton. Russia started looking around for alternative suppliers. Middle Asia could become a new market.

After defeat in Crimea Russian war effort concentrated on Middle Asia.  
Bukhara and Khiva became protectorates and remained independent. Islam still reigned.  
Status quo was largely preserved.  
New asian colonies were supposed to support Russian economy. Asian cotton was transported by a railway.  
Russian presense was limited.

*all'y, cott'on ffs*

Russian Empire technicaly didn't have colonies, but excercised colonial policies on multiple regions

Nicholas I was scared of national and revolutionary movements in Europe.  
Wanted to build a strong state, started repressions.

## Poland - forced integration after 1863
1863 Polish uprising
400 rebels executed, 20000 deported to Siberia. 2500 estates confiscated from Polish nobles
Poland --> Privislinski krai. Official language Russian. Judiciary Russian. Repressions of Catholic church, monasteries closed, property secularized.

Ban on Lithuanian, Belorussian and Ukraininan languages.  
Led to developement of Ukrainian national movements  
Forced conversion to orthodox  
Administrative pressure on the Baltic provinces  

Theory of Checzh (?) historian Miloslav Przhzezhizhchko  
Phase A: Small educated group develops an interest in language & folklore of an ethnicity  
Phase B: Cultural awakening. Agitation among the masses, patriots trying to instill national conciousness and build an ethnic community.  
Phase C: Mass movement. Ethnic group seeks political autonomy

In 20th century national movements started striving for political independence.  

Less than half of RE population was ethnically Russian (43% in 1880s). 67% Slavic.

### Old ethnic groups
Have experienced independence throughout their respective history. More educated.  
Finns, Poles, Georgians, Ukrainians to an extent.  
Poles: past phase A in late 18th - early 19th

PA Stolypin tried to continue reforms

# Bolsheviks
Self-determination for every national group

1918 Constituent Assembly  
Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty - third of population and 2/3 of industrial potential left. All territories gained since XVII

## USSR as a multiethnic state

Why'd they even win?
- the whites had a reactionary program including strict national policy 
- bolsheviks promised social justice
- were flexible in the face of national demands

# National policy of the Soviet Union
Bolsheviks strived to gather lands of the late Russian Empire  
1918 - first constitution
1921 - 1928 New Economic Policy; liberal national policy   
1922 - foundation of USSR and first republics

1920s - ideal model of national policy in multiethnic state

Bukharin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin  
Stalin was least popular but held an importal position of party secretary. Had a big influence on young party members.   
Bukharin supported NEP and agriculture; Stalin rooted for heavy industry.  
NEP ended  
1929 - first 5-year plan; goal is to make the country an industrial one.  
Collectivisation in agriculture.  

New industry in Siberia, Urals, Northen Kazakhstan - regions with mostly native russian population.  
Collectivisation mostly influenced non-russians.  
Cotton plantations, single-crop economy in Middle Asia.  
Many nomadic clans were forced to settle.  
1932-1924 - requisitioning of grain led to famine in Ukraine and ethnically mixed areas to the north of the Caucasus and on lower Volga, 3 to 7 mil dead

Purges of Ukrainian elites  
1936-1938 wave of terror in non-russian republics. Political and intellectual elites decimated.  
By the end of 1930s republics under full central contorl, federalism only on paper. Liberal cultural policy terminated, education unified.

Russian introduced to schools as compulsory, new cyrillic alphabet instead of latin  
Russians were over-represented in politics, science and arts.

Then along with general internal policy national policy became repressive as well, until the early 1980s  
Several purges in Ukraine, Georgia and others.  
National and anti-jew policy, though never extrmist.  

Population briefly rose and then stagnated again, except for Asians.   
Russians migrated to Kazakhstan (64% population in 1979), to Estonia and Latvia (~30%)


## Deportation during WW2
2 million people were deported to Asia (mainly Kazakhstan) and used as forced labor. About 30% died

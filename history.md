Expansion to the West
Three partitions of Poland.
European scholars name the 4th partition. Kingdom of Poland inside Russian Empire, had constitution. Poland had their own parliament, had
leverage in PA. Some say it was Alexander I constitutional experiment. But as far as enlightened absolutism was concerned, constitution 
was a no go.

## Jewish problem
The largest Jewish community in Europe was in Poland => became a part of Russia. One other idea of EA was tolerance towards 
all ethnicities and religions, so E-II was tolerant. Jews had a special kind of self-organisation in place, doing fiscal,
judicial, martial and other stuff. E-II was afraid of national movements, so in late 1780 she started to incorporate Jews 
into the existing Russian structure.

There were several estates:
- merchants (three guilds)
- peasants
- nobles
- urban citizens
Which ones should the Jews go to? Merchants/urbans depending on the wealth.

There was some discrimination in place, namely double tax burden. 
In 1804 A-I defined a pale of Jewish settlements, outside of which they were not permitted to settle. (Polish areas, left-bank Ukraine, New Russia).
On the other hand the statute confirmed their religious freedom and economic priveleges.

## Autonomy of Finland
Part of Finland was occupied during Nothern war, was a region of Sweden. Finns were a minority there, policies were similar to those Russia
imposed on Middle Asia in XIX century. 
Karelia was incorporated into Russia. Other part stayed in Sweden. This lasted till XIX century.
Russian part was incorporated into economics, social system etc; was better developed than Swedish Finland.

Finland was the second experimental territory.

## Bessarabia
Transnistria these days/

Snatched from Ottoman Empire in 1812. Romanian-speaking nobility and the orthodox clergy. Romanian-speaking peasants were free.
Nobility co-opted, peasantsremained free, Orthodox church was recognized within the eparchy of Kishinev.

All in all, rather mild and chill behaviour.

At the end of XVIII Russians comprised 53% of population, Ukrainians - 22%, Belorussians - 7%

Highest levels of autonomy - Poland and Finland.
Low autonomy - Bessarabia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbijan.


## Colonial expansion in Asia
"Mission" in Asia, civilizing the savage nomads.
In 1822 Speransky establised a new estate - инородцы, a transitional stage to a full citizenship for hunters, gatherers and fishermen in Asia. Europeans were citizens
straight away though - racism detected!
